                        <h4>Home Owners Association Audit</h4>
                        <p>Property ownership offers several advantages, but it is essential to properly manage and maintain your investment in order to get the most out of it. And it is here that the Home Owners Association (HOA) audit comes into effect. The Home Owner Association is a non-profit organization that manages the common areas of co-owned residences. According to Dubai law, every freehold property must have an owner’s association, which must include all of the property’s unit owners.</p>

                        <p>When several title deed holders are present in Dubai, the Jointly Owned Property Law creates an Owners Association to manage the common areas of buildings or communities. The Dubai Home Owners Association is in charge of three key areas:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1. Management</li>
                            <li>2. Monitoring</li>
                            <li>3. Maintenance of the property’s common spaces on behalf of the owners</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>Normally, all Owners Associations/Body Corporates delegate management to a certified association manager. Instead of assessing the HOA’s financial transactions on your own, it is preferable to engage the help of a third-party professional who can take a good look at your monetary practice and provide an accurate overview.</p>
