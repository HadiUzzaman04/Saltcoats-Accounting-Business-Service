                        <h4>Scope of Application</h4>

                        <p>All UAE companies and commercial activities conducted by legal organisations or people throughout the seven emirates will be subject to the corporate tax. Natural resource exploitation will continue to be exempted as it is subject to an emirate-level corporate tax.</p>
                        <p>All operations carried out by a legal entity are considered “business activities” and are subject to the corporate tax framework. But at the other side, if an individual possesses a business license or license to conduct their necessary tasks in the UAE, that individual will be judged to have a “business” that comes within the scope of the CT Law.</p>
                        <p>The federal corporate tax will apply to companies formed in the UAE’s free zones or financial free zones. But, it seems that such businesses will benefit enormously from eligible tax cuts and subsidies in the form and for the term specified by the appropriate free zone authority’s regulatory regime.</p>
                        <p>For example, the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC) legislation and the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) law both state that a DIFC- or ADGM-incorporated firm pays no tax for the first 50 years after the law is enacted. As a result, firms formed in the DIFC and ADGM might consider paying no tax until 2071 and 2063, accordingly.</p>
                        <p>It’s unknown if free zone firms’ tax status will alter according as to whether they operate inside or outside the free zone.</p>

                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                        <p>The new approach, which is set to go into force next year, aims to increase the UAE’s reputation as a worldwide business and investment hub while also meeting international tax integrity criteria and preventing illicit and fraudulent practices.</p>
                        <p>This declaration allows businesses in the UAE about a year and a half to gear up for taxes, and it will be fascinating to see how companies in the UAE implement various strategies to ensure adherence to the projected new international tax rules while also making sure the UAE remains a desirable area for businesses to function.</p>
